    when to choose relational database
- you must use strict schema rules and must enforce
- your database doesn't need extreme read and write

    when to choose non-relational database
- you need your database to scale horizontally
- your data first lend itself well to traditional schema

    relational database services
- amazon relation database service (amazon RDS)
- amazon aurora

    non relational database service
- amazon dynamoDB
- amazon elasticache
- amazon neptune

    Concept of dynamoDB
- stores data in partition based on the partition key
- simple primary key the key determines which partitions are selected
- composite primary key the key still determines which partitions are selected on the key but the order is based on the sort key
- use to query data based on non-primary-key attributes
    - secondary index defines an alternate key
- contain
    - alternate key
    - primary key
    - optional subset of other attributes from the base table
- can be one of two type
    - global secondary index
    - local secondary index

    read write
- dynamoDB maintain multiple copies of data for durability
    - all copies of your data are usually consistent within a second after a write operation
- eventually consisted read might return slight stale data if a read operation is performed immediately after a write operation
- simplify the developer experience of making coordinated all or nothing changes to multiple items both across the platform

    read capacity unit(RCU)
- number of strong consistent reads per second of items that are up to 4kb in size
- eventually consistent read are use half of the provisioned read capacity
    write capacity unit(WCU)
- number of 1kb per second

- pay per request pricing for rea and write request
- dynamodb adapt rapidly to accommodate the workload
- request rate is limited by throughout default table limit
- create or update a table to use on demand mode
- streams are observed changes in data
- streams are composed of shards of data
- streams can be consumed by other aws services like aws lambda
- global tables replicate dynamodb tables across aws regions

    DynamoDB api operations
- control operation
    - Create and manage dynamoDB tables
- data operation
    - create read update and delete actions on data in a table
- batch operation
    - ge and write batches of item in table
- transaction
    - make coordinated all or nothing change to multiple table
