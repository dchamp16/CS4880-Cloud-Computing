## Understanding Serverless Computing

* **Levels of Abstraction**
   * **On-Premises:** You manage everything: hardware, operating systems, networking, middleware, and your code.
   * **Virtual Servers in the Cloud (IaaS):** The cloud provider handles hardware; you manage operating systems, networking, middleware, and code. (Example: Amazon EC2)
   * **Containers (CaaS):** Package your code and dependencies into portable containers. Services manage container execution and scaling. (Examples: Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS)
   * **Serverless (FaaS):** You focus purely on code (functions). The cloud provider handles the execution environment, scaling, and even precise billing. (Example: AWS Lambda)

## From Monoliths to Microservices

* **Monolithic Applications:**
    * All components (frontend, backend, database) are tightly coupled in a single codebase.
    * Pros: Simpler initial development, good for small applications.
    * Cons: Hard to scale specific parts, changes become risky, tied to older technologies.

* **Microservices:**
    * Application broken down into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
    * Pros: Scalable, faster updates, failure resilience, freedom to use different technologies for each service.
    * Cons: Increased complexity in design and communication.

* **Why the Shift?** Microservices address limitations of monoliths, enabling greater scalability, agility, and flexibility.

## AWS Lambda: Serverless in Action

* **What is Lambda?** AWS's serverless compute service. You write code as functions; Lambda handles the rest.
* **Features:** 
    * Bring your own code (various languages supported).
    * Easy integration with other AWS services.
    * Flexible resources and pay-per-use billing.
    * Built-in security and fault tolerance.

* **Invoking Lambda:**
    * **Synchronous:** Call the function and wait for the response (e.g., for web requests)
    * **Asynchronous:** Trigger the function, let Lambda handle completion (e.g., for image processing) 

* **Permissions:**
    * **Execution Role:** What your function can do (actions on other AWS services).
    * **Resource-Based Policies:** Who/what can trigger your function.

* **Function Handler:** The entry point of your Lambda code. Receives an event (trigger data) and context (runtime info).

* **Deployment Methods**
    * **AWS Console:** Good for simple functions and beginners.
    * **AWS SAM:** Define infrastructure as code; ideal for complex serverless applications.
    * **AWS CLI:** For scripting and automation.
    * **AWS SDKs:** For deployments integrated into your custom applications.
